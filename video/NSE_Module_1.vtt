Let's pause for a moment while you reflect

00:00:02.856 --> 00:00:06.066 A:middle
on how Systems Engineering is contributing

00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.606 A:middle
to NASA project success.

00:00:08.906 --> 00:00:12.126 A:middle
And then, take a moment and think about what you would do

00:00:12.376 --> 00:00:13.276 A:middle
to make things better.
